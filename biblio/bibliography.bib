abstract = {Direct numerical integration of the wave equation is used to establish the validity of approximating the fundamental mode of graded-index fibers by a Gaussian function. We show that the fundamental modes of fibers, whose index profile can be expressed as a power law, are indeed very nearly Gaussian in shape (that is probably also true for graded-index fibers with convex profiles other than a power law). Graphs and empirical analytical expressions are presented for the optimum Gaussian beam width parameter and for the propagation constant of the fundamental mode.},

abstract = {Optical soliton is a nonlinear wave with huge information or data which travels over larger distance in optical fibers. This paramount application of optical soliton forced many mathematicians and physicians to focus on it which initiates to study the soliton solutions of mathematical model in optical fiber communication characterized by nonlinear Schrodinger equation (NLSE) along with its important applications. Nonlinear Schrodinger equation represents propagation of light pulse through an optical fiber. In this paper NLSE is solved numerically by using exponential cubic B-spline differential quadrature method. In this method leave-one out cross validation strategy is being used to find optimal value of parameter p which enhances accuracy and efficiency of its results which are near to exact solutions and approximate to available numerical solutions in the literature.}

  abstract = {Communication using the optical fibre channel can be challenging due to nonlinear effects that arise in the optical propagation. These effects represent physical processes that originate from light propagation in optical fibres. To obtain fundamental understandings of these processes, mathematical models are typically used. These models are based on approximations of the nonlinear Schrödinger equation, the differential equation that governs the propagation in an optical fibre. All available models in the literature are restricted to certain regimes of operation. Here, we present an approximate model for the nonlinear optical fibre channel in the weak-dispersion regime, in a noiseless scenario. The approximation is obtained by applying regular perturbation theory on the group-velocity dispersion parameter of the nonlinear Schrödinger equation. The proposed model is compared with three other models using the normalized square deviation metric and shown to be significantly more accurate for links with high nonlinearities and weak dispersion.}
