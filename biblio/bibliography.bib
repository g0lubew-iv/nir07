We show that the fundamental modes of fibers, whose index profile can be expressed as a power law, are indeed very nearly Gaussian in shape (that is probably also true for graded-index fibers with convex profiles other than a power law). Graphs and empirical analytical expressions are presented for the optimum Gaussian beam width parameter and for the propagation constant of the fundamental mode.},

This paramount application of optical soliton forced many mathematicians and physicians to focus on it which initiates to study the soliton solutions of mathematical model in optical fiber communication characterized by nonlinear Schrodinger equation (NLSE) along with its important applications. Nonlinear Schrodinger equation represents propagation of light pulse through an optical fiber. In this paper NLSE is solved numerically by using exponential cubic B-spline differential quadrature method. In this method leave-one out cross validation strategy is being used to find optimal value of parameter p which enhances accuracy and efficiency of its results which are near to exact solutions and approximate to available numerical solutions in the literature.}

  abstract = {Communication using the optical fibre channel can be challenging due to nonlinear effects that arise in the optical propagation. These effects represent physical processes that originate from light propagation in optical fibres. To obtain fundamental understandings of these processes, mathematical models are typically used. These models are based on approximations of the nonlinear Schrödinger equation, the differential equation that governs the propagation in an optical fibre. All available models in the literature are restricted to certain regimes of operation. Here, we present an approximate model for the nonlinear optical fibre channel in the weak-dispersion regime, in a noiseless scenario. The approximation is obtained by applying regular perturbation theory on the group-velocity dispersion parameter of the nonlinear Schrödinger equation. The proposed model is compared with three other models using the normalized square deviation metric and shown to be significantly more accurate for links with high nonlinearities and weak dispersion.}

abstract = {We investigated the Rayleigh scattering of ternary glass systems K2O–MgO–SiO2 and Na2O–B2O3–SiO2. The minimum Rayleigh scattering coefficients in both glasses were considerably lower than that in pure silica glass. The Rayleigh scattering due to concentration fluctuation of Na2O–B2O3–SiO2 glass increased rapidly with decreasing Na2O content. By contrast, that of K2O–MgO–SiO2 glass was almost independent of the K2O content. We found that K2O–MgO–SiO2 glasses with a high SiO2 content (70∼75 mol%) can be expected as candidates for fabricating ultralow loss fiber because of their low Rayleigh scattering, zero material dispersion wavelength near 1.55 μm.}

We identify a relation between the out-of-band gain and the in-band error when the filter is implemented with finite-precision arithmetic. In particular, a large out-of-band gain makes the filter more sensitive to coefficient quantization errors due to finite precision digital signal processing. To improve robustness to coefficient quantization errors, our proposed filter is designed based on confining the out-of-band gain. By means of simulations, we show that our filter outperforms other existing FIR filters. The performance gain improves with increasing modulation order and decreasing number of bits used to represent the filter taps.},
